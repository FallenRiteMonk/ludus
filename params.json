ONLY THE TEXT!!!)\r\n\r\n### Creating a pull request\r\n\r\nTo keep the code and the history as clean as possible only PRs with the following structure are accepted:\r\n* The code is constantly checked by travis-ci. There for the code must always be able to pass the ```./gradlew build``` command. This command builds the project and checks for linting errors.\r\nFor the contribution to pass this build it may not contain code that fires a lint error or warning.\r\nIf for some reason a rule has to be added to the ignore list in the lintOptions section of the gradle build file, this has to be stated and explained in the PR, in order to discuss if a exception is made.\r\n* A PR must consist of only one single commit. This doesn't mean that one may not commit any changes during work in progress, but has to squash his commits before the PR is merged.\r\nFor help on squashing commits, read this [post](feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/combining-multiple-commits-into-one/).\r\n\r\n### Useful links\r\n\r\n* [Branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) describing the desired work flow.\r\n* [Github contribution](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing) guidelines for contributing to an open source project.\r\n* [Github fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) guidelines for forking to an open source project.\r\n* [Android way](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/language.html#CreateDirs) of handling locale files.\r\n* [Squashing](feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/combining-multiple-commits-into-one/) multiple commits into one.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any question that comes to your mind in our [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/FRM-ludus),\r\nnot because it would bother me if you write me an e-mail, but because I there is no such thing as a dumb, stupid or useless question and therefore it might also be of value for somebody else.\r\n\r\n# Thanks to all the contributors\r\n\r\n## Tranlations\r\n\r\nTranslater | Language\r\n-----------|-----------\r\n[Şafak Eşberk](https://github.com/safakesberk) | Turkish\r\n","google":"UA-62157119-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
