<p>#-ludus ia a android game with the goal to eliminate all the numbers on the game field by combining those numbers that are same or sum up to 10.<br>
The player starts of with three rows, filled with the numbers from 1 to 19, without the number 10, as discrete digits.
He then has to eliminate all numbers by combining those above or next to each other (over empty fields and over new rows are also allowed).
If the point of no further combinations is reached, the remaining numbers get added to the end of the game field again, without the empty spaces.
This game flow continues until the player eliminates all the numbers on the game field.</p>

<a id="coding" class="anchor" href="#coding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coding</h3>

<p>To contribute by fixing bugs or implementing features try to follow these steps, so that the community can track your work:</p>

<ul>
<li>(For features, not mandatory) Discuss the new feature idea in the google group to find out what the community thinks and for help in finalizing the idea.</li>
<li>If not already present state a new issue explaining the bug or feature and write a comment saying that you are working on this bug/feature.</li>
<li>Keep the issue up to date by reporting the state of your work (mainly for time taking fixes or implementations).</li>
<li>Create a pull request with a link to the issue this PR is going to fix/implement (see "Creating a pull request" section bellow for detailed description).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="translating" class="anchor" href="#translating" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Translating</h3>

<p>The project contains two places where it contains locale files, one in the source code under app/main/res/values, which are for the app it self, and one under resources/strings, which are for external strings like the play store.
To translate the locale files in the source code just follow the <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/language.html#CreateDirs">android way</a> of working with locale string files.
The files in the resources folder follow a similar structure, just create a new file .xml, copy the en.xml content into it and start translating the texts between the xml tags (!!!DON'T CHANGE THE TAGS!!! ONLY THE TEXT!!!)</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-a-pull-request" class="anchor" href="#creating-a-pull-request" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a pull request</h3>

<p>To keep the code and the history as clean as possible only PRs with the following structure are accepted:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code is constantly checked by travis-ci. There for the code must always be able to pass the <code>./gradlew build</code> command. This command builds the project and checks for linting errors.
For the contribution to pass this build it may not contain code that fires a lint error or warning.
If for some reason a rule has to be added to the ignore list in the lintOptions section of the gradle build file, this has to be stated and explained in the PR, in order to discuss if a exception is made.</li>
<li>A PR must consist of only one single commit. This doesn't mean that one may not commit any changes during work in progress, but has to squash his commits before the PR is merged.
For help on squashing commits, read this <a href="feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/combining-multiple-commits-into-one/">post</a>.</li>
